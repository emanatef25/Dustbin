# AUTOMATIC DUSTBIN
Smart Dustbin works smartly or we can say that it is an
automatic dustbin. It works like when you will come in front
of this dust bin it will open automatically with the help of a
servo motor. so there is some sensor work to detect the
object in front of the dustbin
## components
* Arduino Uno
* Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04
* Servo Motor SG90
### Installation and Usage
* Connect the VCC pin of the ultrasonic sensor to the 5V pin on the Arduino
* Connect the GND pin to the GND pin on the Arduino
* Connect the TRIG pin to pin 12 on the Arduino
* Connect the ECHO pin to pin 11 on the Arduino
* Connect the GND pin of the servo motor to the GND pin on the Arduino
* Connect the VCC pin to the 5V pin on the Arduino
* Connect the signal pin to pin 3 on the Arduino
